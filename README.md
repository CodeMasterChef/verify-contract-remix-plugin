# verify-contract-remix-plugin

(Forked from https://github.com/Machinalabs/remix-etherscan-plugin.git)

A plugin to verify contracts on mainnet and testnet for Etherscan and BscScan.

To verify smart contracts, the first thing you need to do is to compile smart contracts.

Once the contracts are compiled, go to the plugin and you can select the smart contract you wish to verify. Then, include parameters if required and just click verify.
